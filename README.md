This is the implementation of our paper: Towards High-Order Complementary Recommendation via Logical Reasoning Network.

In this work, we propose a logical reasoning network: LogiRec to capture the asymmetric complementary relationship between products and seamlessly extend to the high-order recommendation.


## Examples to run LogiRec:
