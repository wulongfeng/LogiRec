# LogiRec


This is the implementation of our paper: Towards High-Order Complementary Recommendation via Logical Reasoning Network.


## Introduction

In this work, we propose a logical reasoning network: LogiRec to capture the asymmetric complementary relationship between products and seamlessly extend it to the high-order recommendation where more comprehensive and meaningful complementary relationship is learned from a query set of products. Finally, we further propose a hybrid network that is jointly optimized for learning a more generic product representation.


## Dataset

We provide the processed dataset. The data in the default folder is trained for LogiRec<sub>Hybrid</sub>  model, in highOrder is for LogiRec<sub>High</sub>, and for LogiRec<sub>Low</sub> in lowOrder.



## Example to run LogiRec

	bash example.sh
